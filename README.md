# Game-Theory
Simultaneous QUATRO-UNO: 
There are two players, and each one gets 4 cards, a
"4", a "3", a "2", a "1". Each player orders his or her four cards into a pile. Then repeatedly both players reveal their
leftmost card. The lower card is taken away from the pile, thrown away, and the higher one, the winning one,
remains in the pile. In case of identical cards, both cards are removed. There is also one exception: If one card is a "1"
and the other a "4", then both cards are removed. The first player having an empty pile loses.
Each player (independently) selects a pile by clicking on the available cards. Then these choices are given to the
referee who clicks on the available cards to create the piles from left to right. Once both piles are determined, the
process starts automatically. Then lean back and observe. When the game is finished, you can play another one.


Task2: 
- Type of game (ZeroSum - NonZeroSum).
- Number of moves for Player 1.
- Number of moves for Player 2.
- Payoffs of the constructed bimatrix between those two players.
Then, the program should find the following:
- Maximin moves.
- Eliminated version (by dominance).
- Best response
- Nash equilibria.
- Pure or mixed strategy (showing ratios/probabilities).

RPS:
a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game with a graphical user interface. It
utilizes Python's Tkinter library to create a visually appealing and interactive experience.
The core mechanics rely on a predefined game logic stored in a dictionary, while random
number generation simulates the computer's choice. By clicking buttons representing
"rock", "paper", or "scissors", the user interacts with the game, and the code determines
the winner based on the established rules. Scores are tracked throughout the game, and
the outcome is displayed along with corresponding images for the user's and computer's
choices.
